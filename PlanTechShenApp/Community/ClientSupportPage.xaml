            <Label Text="You can easily update your password or email address from within the PlanTech-She'n app. Be sure to download the latest version from the app store. Then, from the Garden Answers app home page, go to the 'Settings' button and click on 'Update Account'. After making changes click on the 'Save Settings' button at the bottom or your changes will not be saved. 
Please keep in mind these common pitfalls: 
Avoid leading/trailing spaces entered by mistake while updating your password. Remember to write your new password down and avoid characters that can look the same to the eye. For example, confusion caused by uppercase 'I' and lowercase 'L'; letter 'O' and number '0'. Such passwords can be difficult to remember. If you do forget your password don't worry, simply use the forgot password link found at login or send us an email to: support@plantech-she'n.com 
New email addresses must be verified once they have been entered. Our verification email will be sent instantly, if you do not see it in your inbox, please check your spam folder. If found in your spam folder move to your inbox so the link will work properly for verification. We need you to click on that link, we can't do that for you.
